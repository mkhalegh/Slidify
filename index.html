    <h2>What is Modified Mercalli Intensity?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p></br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The effect of an earthquake on the Earth&#39;s surface is called the intensity. 
</br></p></li>
<li><p>The intensity scale consists of a series of certain key responses such as people awakening, movement of furniture, damage to chimneys, and finally - total destruction. 
</br></p></li>
<li><p>This scale, composed of increasing levels of intensity that range from imperceptible shaking to catastrophic destruction, is designated by Roman numerals. It does not have a mathematical basis; instead it is an arbitrary ranking based on observed effects.</p></li>
</ul>

    <h2>How did you feel in a ground shaking?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p></br></p>

<p>This app describes the levels of Modified Mercalli intensity by characteristics of feelings picked from the bar. So,</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose how you felt during a seismic shaking. Pick the best description that fits to what you felt. 
</br></li>
<li>It tells you the coresponding Mercalli Intensity and whether it is severe enough for an alarm.
</br></li>
<li>It also depicts the feeling associated to the shaking level. This helps you visualize the experience.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Applications of the app</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>This app can be useful for following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Surveys: after ground shakings, seismologists would like to investigate the intensity felt by people. 
</br></li>
<li>Education: This simple app can be used in schools and for people in eartquake-prone areas, to learn more about seismic shaking intensities.
</br></li>
<li>Historical events: Using descriptions of feelings reported in books and journals from times that seismlogy was not advanced, helps estimating the seismic moments (in Richter scale).</li>
</ul>
